# Roots-of-a-function
This is a Java application that can find the roots of a function f(x) using prescribed numerical methods and data structures. 
The functions I have used are: x-x^2, ln(x+1) +1 and e^x-3x.
The root-finding numerical methods I have used are: Newton-Raphson, Bisection and Secant. The 4th method I used (which I had to research myself) was False Position.
